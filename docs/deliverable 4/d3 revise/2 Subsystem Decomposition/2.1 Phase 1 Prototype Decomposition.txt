The older design for cuTPS that came about from deliverable 2 is considered to be client/server architecture. Only two subsystems were able to come into existence due to lack of focus on the overall program design and instead efforts were concentrated on providing functional test drivers. Most of the distinguished functionality is grouped by classes which brought about next to none subystems. Since the only subsystems that are existing are the client and server subsystems, these two subsystems are essentially a client/server architecture as shown in the diagram.
